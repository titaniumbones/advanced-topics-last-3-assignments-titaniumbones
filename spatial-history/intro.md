# This Map Should Deal with a Historical Topic You Care About 

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, before the map and buttons. To change the colors, modify the defaults in [style.css](../css/map-styles.css).
